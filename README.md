[Programming with music!!](https://www.musicmatter.co.uk/news/teenage-engineering-op-z-portable-synthesizer-sequencer)

Teenage engineering is one of the most unique music and engineering companies in the industry today.
They are in the businees of creating everything musical from speakers to synthesizers, focusing on pushing the boundries. Their pocket-operator series packages powerful synths into pocket sized devices and their OP-1 manages to fit production software and a studios worth of instruments into a device the size of a book. However the instrument I am most intrigued by is the OP-Z sequencer and synthesizer which allows musicains to programaticly create and modify visuals that sync to the tunes they create. It's a fantastic device that uses a custom library to connect the device to the unity engine. This connection allows a whole new world of possibilities in live music and I urge you to read more about it!
